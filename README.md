# Applications of Baire's Category Theorem

This repository contains the research project titled **"Applications of Baire's Category Theorem"** done in the second year of my B.Sc. Hons Mathematics, submitted as part of the **Professor Nagpaul Fellowship** organized by the **Mathematics Society, St. Stephenâ€™s College**.

## Overview

It contains the **Baire Category Theorem** and its proof. It further explores various applications of the Theorem in metric spaces and its implications in areas such as:

1. The existence of continuous functions which is not differentiable at any point.
2. The non-existence of functions continous on rational but discontinous on irrational numbers.
3. Non-empty complete metric space without isolated points is uncountable.
4. The relationship between infinitely differentiable functions and polynomials.

### Key Topics Covered:

- **Metric Spaces:** Introduction to the basics of metric spaces, open and closed sets, boundedness, and dense sets.
- **Baire's Category Theorem:** Statement and proof of the theorem, followed by its significant applications in real analysis and topology.
- **Applications:** Includes practical examples like functions that are continuous but non-differentiable, and proofs about non-countable sets.

## Acknowledgments

This project was completed under the guidance of **Dr. Manisha Agarwal**, and I am grateful for her mentorship throughout the fellowship. I would also like to thank the **Mathematics Society of St. Stephen's College** and the **Department of Mathematics** for providing us with the opportunity to work on this project as part of the **Professor Nagpaul Fellowship**.
